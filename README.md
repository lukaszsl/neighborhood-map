# The Reykjavik neighborhood map

This is the final project from Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, sponsored by Google.
App shows interesting places to visit in the center of Reykjavik, Iceland.

You can check predefined places which, in my opinion, are worth to visit. Click on the marker to see more information about the place like address or picture. You can also use sidebar where is search box to easly filter locations.

I made the project with React, Google Maps API and Unsplash API.
I used 'react-google-maps' as a base to integrate React and Google Maps.

Or: To build the app for production to the build folder:

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
By default, the create-react-app includes a service worker in the production build.
